Difference between Block storage & Object Storage ?

Block storage and object storage are two different types of storage systems in computing, each with its own characteristics and use cases. Here are the key differences between them:
Block Storage:
Granularity: Block storage divides data into fixed-sized blocks, typically in the form of chunks or blocks, each with a specific address. 
Use Cases: It is well-suited for scenarios where data needs to be accessed and modified frequently, such as databases, virtual machines, and file systems.
 Access: Block storage is attached to a single server or instance, making it accessible only to that server. It appears as a traditional hard drive or storage device to the server. 
Performance: Block storage systems typically offer low-latency and high I/O performance, making them suitable for applications that require fast, direct access to data. 
Scalability: Scaling block storage can be more complex, often requiring manual adjustments or the addition of more storage volumes.
 Examples: AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store), local hard drives, SAN (Storage Area Network).

Object Storage:
Granularity: Object storage stores data as objects, each containing the data, metadata, and a unique identifier.
 Use Cases: It is ideal for storing and managing large amounts of unstructured data, such as images, videos, backups, and archives, where data is rarely modified. 
Access: Object storage is accessible over the internet using HTTP/HTTPS and is designed for distributed access from multiple locations and devices
.Performance: Object storage systems are optimized for durability and scalability rather than low-latency access. They are well-suited for data that is primarily read and not frequently updated.
Scalability: Object storage is highly scalable, and you can easily add or remove objects without manual adjustments or downtime. 
Examples: AWS S3 (Simple Storage Service), Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage.

Difference between static website & dynamic website ?
Static Website: Content is fixed, doesn't change. Pre-generated web pages. Fast and low server load. Examples: Personal blogs, company brochures. 
Dynamic Website: Content generated on the fly. Real-time server-side processing. Interactive and user-specific features. Examples: E-commerce, social media, CMS.

What are the naming rules ?
Must be globally unique. Between 3 and 63 characters. Can only contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and periods. 
Object Names (Keys): Flexible character options. No specific length limit, but consider URL length for access.

What is the major resource of S3 Bucket ?
The major resource in an Amazon S3 bucket is the objects stored within it. Objects are files or data, and the bucket serves as a container for organizing and managing these objects.


Why do we need to host static websites instead of dynamic websites ?
Hosting static websites is preferred for simplicity, speed, scalability, and cost-efficiency when the content doesn't change often. Dynamic websites are necessary for interactive features and 
frequent content updates. The choice depends on your specific website requirements.

What is versioning & Why do we need versioning ?
In Amazon S3, versioning is a feature that allows you to preserve multiple versions of an object. It's essential for data protection, audit trails, rollback, collaboration, 
compliance, and development/testing purposes. Versioning helps safeguard your data and allows you to track changes over time. However, enabling versioning can increase storage costs, so use it judiciously.

What are the objects and types of objects that we are uploading into the S3 Bucket ?

Objects are the fundamental unit of storage in S3, and they can be organized within S3 buckets. They are highly versatile and can store a wide range of data types, making S3 a flexible and 
scalable storage solution for various use cases.

You can upload various types of objects to an Amazon S3 bucket, including:
Standard Objects: Common files like documents and images. 
Archival Objects: For long-term storage. 
Static Website Content: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for hosting websites.
 Database Backups: Backup files from databases. 
Logs: Log files for analysis and monitoring. 
Application Data: Data for application operation. 
Container Images: Docker container images and artifacts. 
Media and Streaming Content: Audio and video files.
 Backup and Recovery: System backups and snapshots. 
Object Metadata: Metadata about stored data. 
IoT Data: Data generated by IoT devices.

Why is MFA Delete important in S3 Bucket object level ?
MFA Delete in S3 at the object level is important because it:
 Prevents accidental object deletions. 
Protects data against unauthorized deletions. 
Enhances compliance and security. 
Maintains an audit trail for object deletions.
Adds an extra layer of security for sensitive data.
Reduces the risk of data loss due to human error or malicious actions

What is S3 Multipart upload ?
Amazon S3 Multipart Upload is a feature for efficiently uploading large files by breaking them into smaller parts. It's faster, more resilient, 
and memory-efficient. You can resume uploads, replicate data, and use lifecycle policies for cost optimization.

What are the storage classes in Amazon S3 ? â€”-----IMP
Standard: Default for frequently accessed data. 
Intelligent-Tiering: Auto-tiers based on usage.
 Standard-IA: Infrequent access with low latency. 
One Zone-IA: Infrequent access with reduced redundancy. 
Glacier: Long-term archival with slow retrieval. Glacier Deep Archive: Lowest cost, long retrieval.
Reduced Redundancy Storage: Non-critical, lower cost.
Outposts: On-premises data center storage. 
S3 on Deep Archive: For Snowball devices. 
S3 on Outposts: Local data storage on Outposts.

What is ACL ?
In Amazon S3, an "ACL" (Access Control List) is a way to manage permissions for objects or buckets by specifying who has access and what actions they can perform. 
It's useful for controlling access, but IAM policies are typically recommended for more robust and flexible access control.

Why do we need ACL ?
Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Amazon S3 are used for: 
Fine-grained control of object-level access. 
Managing public or restricted access.
Legacy support for older systems.
Simpler access control for basic use cases. However, IAM policies are generally recommended for robust and secure access control.

What is a Life cycle policy ? Why do we need to use the life cycle rule ?
A lifecycle policy, in the context of Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), is a set of rules that define how objects stored in an S3 bucket should be managed throughout their lifecycle. 
These rules specify actions to be taken on objects based on criteria such as object age, access patterns, and storage class. Lifecycle policies are used to automate and optimize data management, 
including data retention, archiving, and cost reduction

Here's why you need to use lifecycle rules in S3:
Data Management: Lifecycle policies help you efficiently manage your data throughout its lifecycle. You can define rules to transition objects between storage classes, delete old versions, or archive data that is no longer actively used. 
Cost 
Optimization: By setting up lifecycle policies, you can save costs by automatically moving objects to lower-cost storage classes or deleting data that is no longer needed, all without manual intervention.
Compliance: Lifecycle rules can be used to enforce data retention policies, ensuring that data is kept for the required duration and then disposed of as needed to comply with regulations.
Data Archiving: You can archive data for long-term storage or compliance purposes by transitioning it to Glacier or other archival storage classes. 
Object Versioning: When versioning is enabled in your S3 bucket, lifecycle policies can help manage the versioned objects over time by specifying when to transition or delete them. 
Simplified Data Retention: Lifecycle rules streamline data retention and clean-up, reducing the risk of accumulating unnecessary or obsolete data. 
Automation: Lifecycle policies automate data management tasks, reducing the need for manual intervention and human error in data management. Overall, lifecycle policies are akey feature in Amazon S3 that allows you
to efficiently manage data over time, save on storage costs, and ensure compliance with data retention policies. They are particularly valuable when dealing with large volumes of data and data that has changing access patterns and 
retention requirements
