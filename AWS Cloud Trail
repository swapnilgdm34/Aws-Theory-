What is a cloud trail ?
AWS CloudTrail is a service that records actions and events within your AWS account. It captures details like who performed an action, which services were involved, and the outcomes. 
Key features include event logging, log file storage in Amazon S3, integration with other AWS services, and support for security, compliance, and operational monitoring. It helps you track changes, 
troubleshoot issues, and meet audit requirements.
